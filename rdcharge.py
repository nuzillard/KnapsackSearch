python rdcharge.py inputfile.sdf outputfile.sdf --> outputfile.sdf

transforms the input file so that non-zero valence data associated by RDKit to electrically charged atoms
is reset to zero. The input file has to be created by RDKit with the V2000 format.
Does not use RDKit for compound reading and writing.

This module has the same function as novalence.py but has not to interprete the content of the file.
