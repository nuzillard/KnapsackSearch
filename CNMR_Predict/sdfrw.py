"""
The module sdfrw.py provides:
- sdfReader(fh) yields compounds stored in an opened sdf file, accessed to by file handle fh (this is an iterator, not a function)
- sdfReaderVariant(fh) like sdfReader(fh) but with that funny variant of SDF file structure returned by ClassyFire.
- sdfWrite(fh, mol) that writes a single compound, mol, to a previously opened text file accessed to by file handle fh
- sdfTransform(filenameIn, filenameOut, transformation=defaultTransformation) that reads molecules,
transforms them, and writes them in an other file. The defaultTransformation leaves compounds unchanged.
- sdfHasProp(mol, sdfprop) --> Boolean
- sdfGetPropList(mol) --> List of strings
- sdfGetProp(mol, sdfprop) --> String
- sdfClearProp(mol, sdfprop) --> (Boolean, molecule)
- sdfClearAllProps(mol) --> molecule
- sdfSetChangeProp(mol, sdfprop, sdfvalue) --> (Boolean, molecule)
- sdfSetNoChangeProp(mol, sdfprop, sdfvalue) --> (Boolean, molecule)
- sdfEmptyMol() --> molecule
- sdfGetMolBlock(mol) --> String
- sdfSetMolBlock(mol, molblock) --> molecule
- sdfGetTitle(mol) --> String
- sdfChangeTitle(mol, newtitle) --> molecule
sdfrw.py does not depend on any toolkit of cheminformatic functions

Reading, writing, changing, and quiering .sdf files with molecule storage as a dictionary with two keys:
"molblock", giving access to the molblock without the final '\n' and
"keyvals", giving access to a list of pairs, the first value is a sdf property name
and the second value is a whole property and value text without the final '\n\n'.
The choice of a list to represent sdf tag and value pairs was made to ensure
that their order is preserved during reading and writing operations.

example: python sdfrw.py flavonoids.sdf
result: creates copied_flavonoids.sdf, a copy of flavonoids.sdf
